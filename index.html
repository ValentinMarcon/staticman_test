    <p>This is a sample page to demonstrate how <a href="https://staticman.net">Staticman</a> can be used to integrate user-generated content into a static site. 
    When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the Staticman API via Ajax, which will push it to <a href="https://github.com/ValentinMarcon/staticman_test">the GitHub repository</a> and cause a regeneration of the Jekyll site.</p>
    <p>This staticman config is based on  <a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/popcorn">popcorn demo</a>, following the <a href="https://staticman.net/docs/">staticman doc</a>, but as staticman bot is broken we use the <a href="https://github.com/apps/staticman-net">static man app</a> currently <a href="https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/issues/243#issuecomment-453754860">under devlopment</a></p>
